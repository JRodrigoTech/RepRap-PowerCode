Greg's Wade extruder for Prusa i3
==================
Just use a regular nema17 motor and Bob's your uncle.

Two things have been changed from regular Greg's, one is the motor location, that has been translated, and the whole thing has been elevated over the base so elements protruding to the back (towards the x-carriage) are now above it.

It fits the standard x-carriage of Prusa i3 (30 mm version, which is the latest).

Based on dviejo's mod.
